# Inventory Management System

### Data Structure Chosen:

Used `HashMap<Integer, Product>` to store products by product_id for:
- O(1) average time for add, update, delete

### Time Complexities:

- Add Product: O(1)
- Update Product: O(1)
- Delete Product: O(1)
- Display Inventory: O(n)

### Reasoning:

HashMap helps us to do fast retrievals and modifications using the product ID as key and it has constant time Complexities.
