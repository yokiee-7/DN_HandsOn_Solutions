Data Structure Chosen: Used Product[] for linear search and Sorted Product[] for binary search.

Time Complexities:

Linear Search: O(n)

Binary Search: O(log n)

Reasoning: Linear search works on unsorted data but becomes slow with more items. Binary search is highly efficient for sorted datasets, making it suitable for faster search functionality at scale.
