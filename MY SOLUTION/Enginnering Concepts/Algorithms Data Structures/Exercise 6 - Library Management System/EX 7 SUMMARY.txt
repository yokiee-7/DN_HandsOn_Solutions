Technique Used: Used recursion to model financial growth over time based on past data.

Time Complexities:

Recursive Forecast: O(2‚Åø) without memoization

Optimized with Memoization: O(n)

Reasoning: Recursive algorithms simplify predictive models but can become inefficient. Optimizing with memoization or converting to iteration helps avoid redundant computation.
