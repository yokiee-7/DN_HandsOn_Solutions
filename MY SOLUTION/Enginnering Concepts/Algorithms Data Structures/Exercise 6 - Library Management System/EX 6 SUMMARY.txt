Data Structure Chosen: Used Book[] for linear search and Sorted Book[] for binary search.

Time Complexities:

Linear Search: O(n)

Binary Search: O(log n)

Reasoning: Linear search works well for small or unsorted datasets. For larger libraries, binary search drastically improves performance when the book list is sorted by title or author.
