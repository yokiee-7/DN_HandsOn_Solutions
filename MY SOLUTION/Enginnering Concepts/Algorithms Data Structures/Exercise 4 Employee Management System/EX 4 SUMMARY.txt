Data Structure Chosen: Used an array Employee[] to store and manage employee records.

Time Complexities:

Add: O(1) (if space available)

Search: O(n)

Traverse: O(n)

Delete: O(n)

Reasoning: Arrays offer fast access and easy traversal, but are limited in size and require shifting elements for deletion, making them less ideal for frequent modifications.
