Data Structure Chosen: Used a singly linked list to manage tasks dynamically.

Time Complexities:

Add (at head): O(1)

Search: O(n)

Traverse: O(n)

Delete: O(n)

Reasoning: Singly linked lists allow dynamic memory use and quick additions/removals, which make them ideal for managing tasks that change frequently.
