Data Structure Chosen: Used Order[] and implemented sorting using Bubble Sort and Quick Sort.

Time Complexities:

Bubble Sort: O(nÂ²)

Quick Sort (average): O(n log n)

Reasoning: Bubble Sort is easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets. Quick Sort performs much faster and is generally preferred due to its efficiency and scalability for sorting customer orders by total price.
